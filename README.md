glcap
=====

Linux Fraps clone, it allows recording on any opengl context


Usage: once you have compiled it, launch the game/application with the environment variable LD_PRELOAD set to full path to libGLCAP.so
Press F12 to start recording and stop
Video files will be saved on your home directory


THIS SOFTWARE IS VERY EXPERIMENTAL AND I'M NOT SURE IF IT COULD TRIGGER ANTICHEAT CHECKS ON GAMES OR NOT, SO IF YOU USE IT ON ONLINE GAMES YOU DO THAT AT YOUR OWN RISK
